            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Joseph or call me <abbr title="Joseph Patrick">JP</abbr>. I was a quality assurance engineer - test lead for <strong>GOMO</strong>, <em>the 1<sup>st</sup> fully digital telecommunication in the Philippines.</em><br>Now, I decided to study here in Algonquin College to pursue my interest in UI/UX design and considering as well to be a Web Developer.<br>I don't like to be uncomforable being comfortable.</p>

            <p>I have a lot of <strong>hobbies</strong> such as watching movies/series, playing video games, singing, and sports (I can play basketball, badminton, volleyball,<br>table tennis, swimming, little bit of golf, and basic surfing) but I think instruments hates me because I can't play any of them. Anyway, doing these<br>things calms my mind, it reminds me to breathe from reality and it really helps both my <em>physical and mental health.</em></p>
